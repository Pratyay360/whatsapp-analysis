## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. Export Your WhatsApp Chat
- Open WhatsApp on your mobile device.
- Navigate to the specific chat (individual or group) you wish to analyze.
- Tap the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner.
- Select **More** → **Export chat**.
- Crucially, choose **"Without Media"**. This ensures faster processing and a smaller file size.
- Save or send the exported `.txt` file or `.zip` (if your device exports as ZIP) to your computer.

### 2. Analyze Your Chat
- Once the Streamlit application is running, use the sidebar to upload your exported `.txt` or `.zip` file.
- If you upload a ZIP with multiple .txt files, you will be prompted to select which chat to analyze.
- After a successful upload, you can select a specific user for focused analysis or choose "Overall" to analyze the entire group's activity.
- Click the "Show Detailed Analysis" button to generate and display the insights.
- Use the **Download PDF Report** button to save your analysis as a PDF file.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1.  **"No valid chat data found" / File Processing Errors:**
    *   Ensure you exported the chat **"Without Media"** from WhatsApp.
    *   Verify the uploaded file is a `.txt` file.
    *   Check if the file contains actual message data and is not corrupted.
    *   The app expects UTF-8 encoding. If you suspect an encoding issue, try re-saving the file with UTF-8 encoding.

2.  **"Error reading stop words file" (if applicable):**
    *   Ensure `bengali_stop_words.txt` (or other custom stop word files) is present in the project's root directory if you're using features that rely on it.
    *   Check the file's encoding (should be UTF-8).

3.  **Visualization or Analysis Errors:**
    *   Confirm all libraries listed in `requirements.txt` are correctly installed in your active Python environment.
    *   Ensure your chat data has sufficient content for the selected analysis (e.g., enough messages for timeline analysis, enough text for word clouds).

### Getting Help
If you encounter persistent issues:
1.  Carefully read the error message displayed in the Streamlit interface or console.
2.  Double-check your WhatsApp export format and the uploaded file.
3.  Ensure your environment is set up correctly with all dependencies.
4.  If the problem persists, consider opening an issue on the project's GitHub repository, providing:
    *   A clear description of the issue.
    *   Steps to reproduce the error.
    *   The error message(s) you received.
    *   Information about your operating system and Python version.
